There are several things that are issues currently. I need to figure out what the goal is exactly. That's a life lesson I learned a long time ago. Also, I just remembered another thing i.e. that I had a tendency of carrying on simple things that should have been resolved earlier to much later on.

I also realize that he's quite paranoid about me -> This I'm not sure how to solve, although I guess this is necessary for me to solve it. 

GOAL: Submit my project proposal by Wednesday. 

Idea: Have a mindblowing idea that you can floor Erik with which can be supported by some experiments by tomorrow. Have revisions by end of tomorrow and submit the proposal by Wednesday (October 7th).

Forget the naysayers. 

What is a mindblowing paper? Something that will impress him and cause him to forget all the reservations he had of you. How did I tackle this issue in the past? I'm not entirely sure, to be honest. 

Listen. I have a strong feeling that this might not work out. Like today, like yesterday. At the same time, in the past, I have overcome great odds to accomplish great things. Let's work with what we know okay? Holy Father, I need your help my blessed Lord and Saviour. I need to remember what to do Dear Lord. Being so entrenched in the present is what did it for you, what cut it for you.

Chetan, it is your truth and no one else, just your truth alone sweet Child. Disagreement. Some delusion in her eyes, a burning sense of disbelief and guilt in your own eyes. A veil of smoke and disbelief. A sense of betrayal of being let down. Frodo. 

All the grace you might've given away? Lord, take it away from the undeserving and give it back to me Dear Sovereign. 

My Goal: Have something substantial before 1 pm. What is the best possible thing that I can do currently to ensure that this happens? Pick a really small and simple topic?! Lord please tune up the intensity of my thought, please almighty Lord, and may they also be soothing and bearable by more, Almighty and Divine Saviour. How would Ordinary, Non-Religious Folk deal with this? A modification of that method that might ensure that this will work? 

We could be in the process of negotiating and still request for an extension. In order for this to work, you might have to do a decent job with that aspect too if you ask me. A part of me believes that this might not work out. At the same time, another part of me believes that there might be something that might work in order to make this whole thing have some semblance of working out. Christ, help me. Okay, this is called acceptance, it might not work out. Okay, in that case,
 why don't you get up and leave? Well, it might still work out for all you know my blessed child. 

Goal: have a mindblowing idea, Some of Rosie's papers, and the results of those papers. This might be blasphemy so I'm not even going to dare mention it. Okay, so you do realize the importance of being right right?! Yes, I do. 

Can you link the attention thing to your paper by any chance? I mean, think about that idea you had when it came to attention i.e. what was it exactly Sonnie? Thoughts arise and one has to examine it. Without examination, one might get the impression that something is true even if it isn't an idea, some kind of attention mechanism that decides to pay attention over the last layer and the one before that at the same time if you ask me. What wrong have you done? Other than that you've occasionally taken more than you were supposed to?

Advice: Just look at an immature project. Some clue in his way of thinking when it comes to getting that to work. Also, make sure that you remain as discrete as possible about your endowments until and unless absolutely necessary. That might be a clue too. 

Holy Mother, Blessed Virgin, help me. 

What do you want to happen actually? Well, I want to give him a sensible, reasonable idea actually.  To get a sensible reasonable idea, I need to i. scour the existing literature. However, I want to be honest and say that there is something that I see sense in that tells me that this is not a. 

Okay, let us explore your apprehension in a bit okay.

There are too many papers to read? Well, this depends on what you mean by so many papers. I think the issue is something else if you ask me. Maybe you can spend the next 3 hours actually working on finding the right papers if you ask me.

GOAL: Scour all papers and get a working idea that I can bring forth to Erik and get his support for getting another faculty member on board.

That lack of understanding might be a crux if you ask me. How did I do this in the past?

You need the right approach Love. Too ambitious: I might be afraid of that to be completely honest.

There might not be enough time for this whole vague enterprise. What can I do that will help, how did it work before, why doesn't it work now?

GOAL: Get a \mindblowing idea that will floor Erik within the next 2 hours from research papers. This idea has to be a NOVEL. 

I wouldn't know where to start to be honest. There are so many papers. Which one must I select? Also, I fear I will pick the wrong one. Okay, I understand your concern as being completely valid. However, you must find something now or the order must close. 

Unlike, Princess Alice who had something hidden that she kew about that could solve her problems, I don't have that or maybe I do but I'm not sure what it would be.

Spatial attention features. Keep focusing on your goals if you ask me to be completely honest.

How do humans use attention and intelligence together? I don't know about you but the way I do it is that I have a thought telling me that something is such, if there is truth to that my mind will directly act on that (or at least if my existing paradigm thinks it is true I will jump into it). If it somehow contradicts my existing paradigm, 
I will seek to reconfirm that my directing my attention to the relevant topic. This will not inform my current choice but also, seek to revise my current paradigm that produced it. Okay, the L2M docs that Gautam produced might help as well. 

Well, his pessimism. Her experience does have value but that doesn't give her the right to constantly advise people. 

Lord, I know that it is thou will always. However, Lord I pray to make this express wish of mine part of Thy Divine Will Almighty Lord. It's my sincere wish and desire, Dear Lord. I do want to call it my calling Dear Lord, however, I don't want to see too pompous or arrogant by claiming that Holy Lord.

Please help me Holy Father, Most Blessed, Most Divine, and Most Mighty.

That might be key actually. I keep waiting for divine inspiration. That is most certainly what I need. How do I silence that naysayer?! There's this force that seems to keep pushing me to accept that conclusion. Help me Dearly Beloved and Dearly Blessed.

The reasoning is necessary. It is paramount. However, it can also be a stumbling block. Lord, please immediately operate in me the Modus Operandi that will help me Dearly Beloved. Everything is the universe, everything that falls in thy path, including people who are naysayers are aspects of the universe being sent to guide and assist you Chetan.

Sell out? I'm not sure I'm okay with this. I made it quite clear in the beginning that this needs to be a really good idea. Why are you unhappy, sad, and pissed. Well, the fact that I let things get to this stage gives me serious doubts about the state of my cognition or operating system at this point. At the same time, I realize it is necessary and important for me to get this done come what may. 

Is there some way, I could commune with my intelligence so that it gives me what I need as opposed to things that I constantly need to verify. Can't you trust?!

Well first and foremost, I need to record, that my mind is telling me that there might be some significance in what happened that day in that room. At Heathrow too. How did I accomplish so many fascinating tasks.
What was it that drove me? Was it insecurity? I needed to ensure that there wasn't even a tiny bad speck in my reputation.

I most certainly did have the power to get things done. Although some incidents like that have most certainly eroded my faith in myself. I need to get this semblance of faith in myself back somehow. 

I just realized that I might be preventing the universe from helping me. 

Well, I can make something up. However, at this point in time, I feel like my creativity might be compromised too.
The most important goal at this point is that I should be able to convince him that things are working well. Well, I'm not sure at all how to make this work if you ask me. 

What exactly is going wrong. 


GOAL: Decide what to do after I resume y work at around 10:45 pm.

Right now, the right thing to do in my mind would be to go to sleep. However, I've had an entire pill of that and also a few rounds of whiskey so I'm not sure what to say.

1. Read that simple article on the brilliance/secrets of intelligence.


2. Spend time reflecting on how you would get so much stuff done in the past. What was the secret?  Why did it not work out in that semester? 20

3. Decide to go down or not. 10

4. How will you work on your stuff to ensure this gets done? 20

5. Maybe do it now -> You might as a result of a happy coincidence end up with exactly what you need.
