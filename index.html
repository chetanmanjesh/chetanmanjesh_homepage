<p>
I am an MS/PhD student in the <a href="https://www.cics.umass.edu//"> the College of Information and Computer Sciences</a> working under <a href="https://people.cs.umass.edu/~elm/">Prof. Erik Learned-Miller</a>  in <a href="http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/"> the Computer Vision Lab </a> at <a href="https://www.umass.edu/"> the University of Massachusetts Amherst</a>. I did my undergraduate studies in Computer Science at the <a href="http://www.rvce.edu.in/">R.V. College of Engineering, Visvesvaraya Technological University</a> in Bangalore, India.

<!--
My research interests include studying and analyzing the interplay between cognition, social sciences and large scale data-driven AI to solve problems in areas such as mental health and education.
I'm also quite interested in using Natural Language Processing to understand the subtleties of language use among people affected by different mental disorders. Here's a <a href="http://wecare-mind.com">link</a> to a website that I built for a hackathon along with my teammates that does text-analytics to predict what disorder a person may be suffering from based on comments entered by them about their feelings.

<h3>Hobbies</h3>
I love running and hiking in my past time. I have done a couple of 5ks and I'm constantly seeking to improve my timing (which currently stands at around <a href="http://iresultslive.com/?op=individual&eid=2995&refid=30040198">22 minutes</a>). On weekends I usually spend my time exploring the enchanting wilderness and quaint towns of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pioneer_Valley">Pioneer Valley</a>.
